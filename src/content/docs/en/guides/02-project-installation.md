Once you retrieve your application client ID and client secret, you can now download ManaoBot!
The bot now has an interactive GUI installer that will guide you through the installation process!

### 1. Download the installer

You can download the installer from the link below:
- [ManaoBot Installer for Windows](https://github.com/tinarskii/Manao/releases/download/3.0.0/ManaoBotSetup.exe)
- [ManaoBot Shell Installer Script (MacOS/Linux)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tinarskii/Manao/refs/heads/main/tools/linux/INSTALLER.sh)

---

### 2. Installation process

You can run the installer by double-clicking the downloaded file. 
Follow the instructions on the installer to complete the installation process.

:::tip
Default installation path is `C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\ManaoBot` \
You can change it to your desired location.
:::

You may see powershell window pop up during the installation;
this is normal behavior as the installer uses PowerShell to install required dependencies.

Once the installation is complete, you can select "Run powershell.exe"
to run the setup script, this will be covered in the next guide.
